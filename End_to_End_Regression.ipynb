    "As a senior data scientist in a corporate setting, I'll outline the steps to build a regression model for a pharmaceutical company. Let's assume the business problem is to predict the efficacy of a new drug based on various factors such as patient demographics, medical history, and genetic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection and Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pharmaceutical company uses a combination of electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical trial management systems (CTMS) to store patient data. The EHRs are stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, while the CTMS data is stored in a cloud-based platform like Amazon Redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the data from the client, I would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) services such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**: To migrate the EHR data from the on-premises MySQL database to Amazon Redshift.\n",
    "2. **AWS Glue**: To extract, transform, and load (ETL) the CTMS data from the cloud-based platform to Amazon Redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Lake/Data Warehouse**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I would use Amazon Redshift as the data warehouse, as it provides a scalable and secure platform for storing and analyzing large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Extraction and Model Building**\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the data from Amazon Redshift and build the regression model, I would use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AWS Sagemaker**: A fully managed service that provides a platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.\n",
    "2. **AWS Sagemaker Notebook**: A web-based interface for data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Right Regression Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the right regression model, I would use a combination of domain expertise, data analysis, and experimentation. I would loop over various regression models such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and target variable.\n",
    "2. **Ridge Regression**: A linear regression model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Lasso Regression**: A linear regression model with L1 regularization to prevent overfitting and select features.\n",
    "4. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to predict the target variable.\n",
    "5. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to predict the target variable, with a focus on gradient boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. I would also use techniques such as cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "To tune the model, I would use a combination of grid search and random search to find the optimal hyperparameters. I would write a separate Python script using modular programming to perform the hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the regression model, I would use a design pattern such as the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern. This pattern separates the model (regression algorithm), view (data visualization), and controller (data processing) into separate components, making it easier to maintain and update the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ZenML**\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a pipeline and automate the workflow, I would use **ZenML**, a Python library that provides a simple and intuitive way to define and run data pipelines. ZenML allows me to define the pipeline using a Python script and then run it on a schedule or on-demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline would consist of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion**: Extract data from Amazon Redshift and load it into AWS Sagemaker.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data using AWS Sagemaker Notebook.\n",
    "3. **Model Building**: Build and train the regression model using AWS Sagemaker.\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R-squared.\n",
    "5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model to a production environment using AWS Sagemaker.\n",
    "6. **Prediction**: Use the deployed model to make predictions on new data and store the results in Amazon Redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate the pipeline, I would use **AWS CloudWatch Events** to schedule the pipeline to run on a regular basis (e.g., daily, weekly). I would also use **AWS Lambda** to run the pipeline on-demand, in response to changes in the data or model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools, Software, and Services**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools, software, and services used in this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AWS**: Amazon Web Services, including Amazon Redshift, AWS Sagemaker, AWS Glue, and AWS Lambda.\n",
    "2. **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis, model building, and pipeline automation.\n",
    "3. **ZenML**: A Python library for building and running data pipelines.\n",
    "4. **AWS CloudWatch Events**: A service for scheduling and running tasks on a regular basis.\n",
    "5. **AWS Lambda**: A service for running code on-demand, in response to events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates the pipeline:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    print(new_y_pred)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the pipeline\n",
    "regression_pipeline.run()\n",
    "```\n",
